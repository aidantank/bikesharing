# Bikesharing
## Overview
The goal of this report is to create a business proposal for a new bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. Using [citibike data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) from New York City in 2019, we will create a presentation using Tableau Public for shareholders. We decided to choose August data as it is a common month for biking. The results section will have descriptions regarding the presentation slides and we will finish with high level summary about how to create a successful bikesharing company in Iowa.
